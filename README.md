# Spiral-matrix-leetcode-problem
A spiral matrix is a matrix where elements are traversed in a spiral order, starting from the top-left corner and moving right, down, left, and up in cycles, until all elements have been visited. This traversal pattern can be seen as a clockwise or counterclockwise "spiral" covering the entire matrix.

Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
